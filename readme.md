# Boilerplate

This is my boilerplate. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## The Stack


 * [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for modules and bundling.
 * [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and TSLint for sanity.

 * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for the view layer stuff.
